# Lab Report 5

## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

1. The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is

The original post on EdStem:
Hello guys, 
I have some issues with my code in a ```ListExamples.java``` class specifically in the merge method since it doesn't pass all of the tests on the test file ```TestListExamples.java```. I think the bugs might be in the if-conditional statement that I set but I am not too sure if that will be the case to cause the errors.



2. TA's response:
   
3. Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is
   

4. At the end, all the information needed about the setup, including:
The file & directory structure needed:

The contents of each file before fixing the bug: 

The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug: 

A description of what to edit to fix the bug:



## Part 2 - Reflection
A couple of things from my lab experience in the second half of this quarter that I didn't know before is creating a grading script to auto-grade student programming assignments. I have wondered how those things work behind the scenes since I took the introductory Java course. I am now able to write a grading script for programming assignments by myself and even know some cool useful commands like ```find``` , ```grep```, ```less``` that help facilitate the grading process.
